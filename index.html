     <p> It is Known as one of the seven wonders of the world, the Taj Mahal in Agra stands as a living testimony of the eternal love between Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan and Queen Mumtaz. Construction of the Taj Mahal started in 1632, and a visit to this UNESCO World Heritage Site will demonstrate why it took this iconic monument so long to complete. The ethereal beauty of this white marble tombstone remains unparalleled to this day. While the Taj Mahal exudes stories of romance, it is also a showcase of the glory of Mughal architecture.
        The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

      Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (U.S. $827 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.

     <p>The Red Fort Complex was built as the palace fort of Shahjahanabad – the new capital of the fifth Mughal Emperor of India, Shah Jahan. Named for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone, it is adjacent to an older fort, the Salimgarh, built by Islam Shah Suri in 1546, with which it forms the Red Fort Complex. The private apartments consist of a row of pavilions connected by a continuous water channel, known as the Nahr-i-Behisht (Stream of Paradise). The Red Fort is considered to represent the zenith of Mughal creativity which, under the Shah Jahan, was brought to a new level of refinement. The planning of the palace is based on Islamic prototypes, but each pavilion reveals architectural elements typical of Mughal building, reflecting a fusion of Persian, Timurid and Hindu traditions The Red Fort’s innovative planning and architectural style, including the garden design, strongly influenced later buildings and gardens in Rajasthan, Delhi, Agra and further afield.</p>

            <p>Ajanta Caves are located 100km north of Aurangabad and take almost 3 hours to reach (road conditions are variable). They are open from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m., daily except Mondays. Entry ticket is Rs. 40 per person (foreigners pay Rs. 600 pp). While you can explore the caves on your own, I recommend hiring a guide to get a complete overview and hear interesting stories. Government-licensed guides are available at the entrance and their fee is Rs. 1,800 for a group of up to five people. Ellora Caves are located 30km northwest of Aurangabad and take about an hour to reach. They are open from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m. (sunrise to sunset), daily except Tuesdays. Entry ticket and guide fee are the same as Ajanta Caves.</p>

            <h2 class="a">4. Gateway of India, Mumbai</h2>
        <img class="d" src="https://mediaindia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/sarang-pande-k3SHcT9zGkE-unsplash-e1578503286127-1200x900.jpg"width="500px">

        <div class="c">
            <p>The Gateway of India has become synonymous with the city of Mumbai. It has remained one of the city’s most popular tourist attractions over the years and is open to the public on all days of the week. The monument is also the starting point for tourists wanting to take a ferry to nearby Elephanta Island, the site of a collection of cave temples designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.
                Owing to its iconic status and huge tourist footfall, the Gateway of India has high security. However, it witnessed a terror attack in 2003, when a bomb left in a nearby taxi exploded. Additionally, the November 2008 terror attacks that targeted several sites in Mumbai included an attack on the Taj Mahal Palace hotel opposite the Gateway of India. Public access to the gateway area was subsequently restricted until the situation was neutralized.</p>

         <p>Qutb-Minar in red and buff standstone is the highest tower in India. It has a diameter of 14.32 m at the base and about 2.75 m on the top with a height of 72.5 m.
          Qutbu'd-Din Aibak laid the foundation of Minar in AD 1199 for the use of the mu'azzin (crier) to give calls for prayer and raised the first storey, to which were added three more storeys by his successor and son-in-law, Shamsu'd-Din Iltutmish (AD 1211-36). All the storeys are surrounded by a projected balcony encircling the minar and supported by stone brackets, which are decorated with honey-comb design, more conspicuously in the first storey.Numerous inscriptions in Arabic and Nagari characters in different places of the minar reveal the history of Qutb. According to the inscriptions on its surface it was repaired by Firuz Shah Tughlaq (AD 1351-88) and Sikandar Lodi (AD 1489-1517). Major R.Smith also repaired and restored the minar in 1829.</p>
